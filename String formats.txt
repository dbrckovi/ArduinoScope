PIN STATUS STRING

String contains status and values of all analog and digital pins
Pins are separated by comma ','
Properties of each pin are separated by colon ':'
Each pin property consist of letter immediately followed by number. 
Letter represents the type of the property and number represents its value.
First property in the string must always be A or D

Property types:
D - represents a digital pin, number represents pin number
A - represents an analog pin, number represents pin number
M - pin mode, number represents value of DigitalPinMode enumeration
V - pin value. Boolean values are represented by 0 or 1
F - frequency of the tone when pin is in Tone mode
L - length (duration) of the tone when pin is in Tone Mode

Examples:

1.) D3:M1:V1
	- digital pin 3 is in BOOL_OUT mode and is turned on (high value)
	
2.) D6:M2:V144
	- digital pin 3 is in PWM mode. duty cycle of the pwm signal is 144
	
3.) D11:M3:F600:L1000
	- digital pin 11 is in Tone mode. Frequency is 600, duration is 1000

4.) D2:M0:V0
	-digital pin 2 is in BOOL_IN mode. It's value is LOW
	
5.) A2:V673
	- analog pin 2 has value 673


6.) D3:M1:V1,D6:M2:V144,D11:M3:F600:L1000,D2:M0:V0,A2:V673
	- all 5 previous examples combined into a single string


	
PIN CONFIG STRING

String returns all digital and analog pins.
Also indicates which digital pins support PWM/TONE function	
String contains status and values of all analog and digital pins
Pins are separated by comma ','
Properties of each pin are separated by colon ':'
Each pin property consist of letter immediately followed by number. 
Letter represents the type of the property and number represents its value.
First property in the string must always be A or D

Property types:
D - represents a digital pin, number represents pin number
A - represents an analog pin, number represents pin number	
S - for digital pins, indicates whether pin supports PWM/TONE. 1 indicates that it does, 0 that it doesn't

The following example is a typical arduino Uno configuration...
 - 14 digital pins of which these support pwm/tone: 3,5,6,9,10,11
 - 6 analog pins

D0:S0,D1:S0,D2:S0,D3:S1,D4:S0,D5:S1,D6:S1,D7:S0,D8:S0,D9:S1,D10:S1,D11:S1,D12:S0,D13:S0,A0,A1,A2,A3,A4,A5
